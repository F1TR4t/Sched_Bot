# Computer Science 321 - Software Engineering
A school project where a group of students attempted to simulate an agile development environment by producing a Discord bot.

The bot was developed with the [Discord4J dependency](https://github.com/Discord4J/Discord4J).

Intentions were to continue development in order to produce a product to rival other Discord bots used for scheduling. Due to delays, it was finally archived and cancelled due to Discord's implementing a feature allowing for events and reminders to be made.

# Requirements
Java 8 JDK
Discord4J
Gradle

# Setup
Using an IDE of your choice (recommend IntelliJ over Eclipse), simply clone this repository, open it as a Gradle project in the IDE, then compile and build the entire project.

Follow [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) walkthrough to create a bot. Retrieve your Discord bot's token and insert it onto line 250 of Bot.java, where it says "[INSERT DISCORD BOT TOKEN]".

# Running locally
After inviting creating a Discord bot, inviting it to your server, and inserted its token onto the designated line, you can run the Bot.java file to activate the bot.
